# 🤖 Transformers Interactive Neural Network Visualizer

**Interactive tool for visualizing an artificial neural network, illustrating data flow from the input layer through hidden layers to the output layer**

## 🚧 Project Status: Under Development

This project is currently in the deployment phase. We're building an interactive neural network visualization tool that makes machine learning accessible and understandable through real-time visual representations of artificial neural networks.

**Coming Soon:** More features are under development, including real-time training, different activation functions, and input data visualization.
